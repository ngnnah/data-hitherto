318,ParcelShellRecord,"Shell records are created in the assessor file when a recording for a new parcel is received.  The shell record is a place-holder in the assessor file to correspond / link to the recorded event.  
Due to assessor files being provided once per year, most recordings are provided for new parcels prior to the assessor providing the newer parcel in the assessor file.  Often times, the new record is not available until the following year.  In some cases, a county may take two or more years before providing the newer parcels in the assessor file.

Example:
11/1/2018 – Assessor Roll is released to all clients.
Parcel 100-100 is for a five acre lot.
1/5/2019 - ABC Builder acquires the property and splits the parcel into 10 separate parcels and begins to build these parcels.
6/1/2019 – ABC Builder has completed construction on these properties and begins to sell them… 
	These new properties will now have newer parcel numbers.. example:
		100-101
		100-102
		100-103.. etc.. 
	However, these newer parcel numbers are not yet part of the current assessor’s tax roll (which was released in 2018)
	It is at this point, when the recordings begin to come in, that the shell records in the assessor files, allowing end users to link the recorder data to an assessor record.",,2
