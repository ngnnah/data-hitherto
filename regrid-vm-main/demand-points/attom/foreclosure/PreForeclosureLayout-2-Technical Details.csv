1,TransactionID,"This is a one to many relationship in which the ATTOM ID is the one and each transaction is the ""many"".  
For example:
 - One Property (assigned its unique ATTOMID) will link to multiple transactions.
 - - - - - - - - - - - - ONE - - - - - - - - - TO - - - - - - - MANY - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
- ATTOMID = 44062519 - - - TransactionID = 108767409 - 02/28/2003 Purchase
- ATTOMID = 44062519 - - - TransactionID = 340770731 - 10/30/2012 Purchase
- ATTOMID = 44062519 - - - TransactionID = 551469298 - 07/08/2015 Purchase
- ATTOMID = 44062519 - - - TransactionID = 717643768 - 05/10/2017 Purchase

Sample Property is:
17258 Sandlewood Dr             Riverside CA 92503
County - Riverside - CA           Parcel #270-410-034            FIPS 06065",,4
2,"ATTOM ID","This field represents an ATTOM DATA Unique identifier assigned to the property during it's entire life in our databases.  
Regardless if the records is a future record, active, or inactive property.
See sample above.",,4
3,RecordType,"Default data is broken out into two stages:
 1st stage - Initial public notice that the borrower is in default
 2nd stage - Setting of the public auction date

Additionally, there are two methods to foreclose on the property:
 1 - Judicial Process - This includes the LisPendens and Judgment.  This particular process is handled via the county's legal/court process.  In layman's terms, a mortgage is a contract and failure to pay would be considered a breach in contract.
2 - Non-Judicial Process - Most commonly includes the Notice of Default and Notice of Trustee Sale where the mortgage or deed of trust includes a ""power of sale"" clause within the instrument, pre-authorizing the lender/trustee to sell the property in the event of default.

Notice of Default = NOD, 
Notice of Trustee Sale = NTS, 
LisPendens = LIS, 
Notice of foreclosure sale = NOS.","See Codes Tab ",3

5,SitusCounty,"i.e. Los Angeles or Dallas, etc…",,50
6,PropertyJurisdictionName,"Generally populated with the county name throughout the nation.  However, in many New England Counties (i.e. CT, MA, NH), there is no ""County Government"" or ""County Taxing Authority/Assesor"".  
Instead, property values and taxes are managed at the local township/municipality level. 
In such counties, this field will be populated with that ""Towns/Muni"" name instead of the county name.",,50
7,SitusStateCountyFIPS,"A five digit code where the first two digits represent the state, and the last three digits represent the county within that state.  
i.e. 06037 where: 
 - - 06 = CA and 
 - - 037 = Los Angeles
County numbers have been assigned in odd sequence - 1,3,5, etc.. this allows for future expansion as new counties are created.  Recent examples include: 
 - Miami-Dade FL (renamed from Dade County) = 12086
 - Broomfield CO (previously Boulder, Adams, Jefferson, and Weld Counties) = 08014",,5
